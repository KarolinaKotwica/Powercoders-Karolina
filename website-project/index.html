                        Hi, my name is Karolina. 28th of March 2022 I started <a class="yellow" href="https://powercoders.org/" target="_blank">Powercoders bootcamp</a>. Powercoders is a work integration program for refugees & migrants. It consists of a coding bootcamp of 13 weeks and an internship that lasts 6 to 12 months. The ultimate goal of Powercoders is the permanent placement of trained refugees in IT-companies and IT-departments. Talented refugees & migrants, independent from their place of living, as long as they are allowed to travel can participate in this program. I am the one of the 26 lucky people. I'd like to show you what I've learned during this 13-weeks. Let's go!

                    <h4 id="version-control">What is version control?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Version control is a tool that allow you to collaborate and track and revert changes. For example when we edit a file version control can help you determinate what exactly who changed it and why.<br>
                        if something goes wrong you can revert your changes and go back to the last version.<br>
                    </p>

                    <!-- Common commands -->
                    <h4 id="commands">List of common commands</h4>
                    <p>On the command line, help is always at hand: you can either type: man command --help</p>
                    <p>If you plan to run a series of commands after another, it might be useful to combine them instead of waiting for each command to finish before typing the next one. To do so, simply separate the commands with a semicolon (;) on the same line</p>
                    <p>Whenever entering paths and file names, the TAB key comes in very handy. It autocompletes what you have written,reducing typos quite efficiently</p>
                    <p>The command line keeps a history of the most recent commands you executed. By pressing the ARROW UP key, you can step through the last called commands (starting with the most recent). ARROW DOWN will move forward in history towards the most recent call. You can also type 'history', that show you all your history.</p>

                        First of all, you have to create new repository on Github. After that, you can see link to your repository and you should copy this. Open terminal for example in Visual Studio Code and enter:<br><br>

                    <p>
                        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Inline and block elements in HTML5 -->
                    <h4 id="inline-block">Inline and block elements in HTML5</h4>
                    <p>
                        Inline elements just take up the space that is absolutely necessary for the content and does not start from a new line. Example:<br><br>
                        &#60;span&#62;, &#60;a&#62;, &#60;strong&#62;, &#60;img&#62;, &#60;button&#62;, &#60;em&#62;, &#60;select&#62;, &#60;abbr&#62;, &#60;label&#62;, &#60;sub&#62;, &#60;cite&#62;, &#60;abbr&#62;, &#60;script&#62;, &#60;label&#62;, &#60;i&#62;, &#60;input&#62;, &#60;output&#62;, &#60;q&#62;, etc.
                    </p>
                        <hr>
                    <p>
                        Block elements start on a new line and consume the full width of the page available. Example:<br><br>
                        &#60;div&#62;, &#60;p&#62;, &#60;header&#62;, &#60;footer&#62;, &#60;h1&#62;...&#60;h6&#62;, &#60;form&#62;, &#60;table&#62;, &#60;canvas&#62;, &#60;video&#62;, &#60;blockquote&#62;, &#60;pre&#62;, &#60;ul&#62;, &#60;ol&#62;, &#60;figcaption&#62;, &#60;figure&#62;, &#60;hr&#62;, &#60;article&#62;, &#60;section&#62;, etc.

                    <p>
                        <b>&#60;header&#62;</b> for introduction of the page, e.g. logo, page headline, content summary.<br>
                        <b>&#60;nav&#62;</b> as container for navigational elements, links to access content within the website<br>
                        <b>&#60;main&#62;</b> for the main and most important content of a page<br>
                        <b>&#60;section&#62;</b> for thematic grouping of content, e.g. news, team<br>
                        <b>&#60;article&#62;</b> is independent, self-contained content, e.g. news entry, blog entry<br>
                        <b>&#60;aside&#62;</b> for less important content, e.g. in a sidebar or overlay<br>
                        <b>&#60;footer&#62;</b> for information at the end of document, e.g. copyright, address, author, legal info<br>

                    <p>
                        &#60;h&#62;-tags can be within different block-level elements, e.g. header, main, article, section, footer. Use hierarchical order of headlines, e.g.<br><br>
                        &#60;h1&#62; in the &#60;header&#62;<br>
                        &#60;h2&#62; in the &#60;section&#62;<br>
                        &#60;h3&#62; in the &#60;article&#62;<br><br>
                        Each article should contain at least 1 headline.
                        Each page should only have 1 &#60;h1&#62;-tag.
                        Don't leave a number out, e.g. first &#60;h1&#62;, then &#60;h3&#62;.

                    <p>
                        <span class='yellow'>Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</span><br>
                        HTML tags and elements are not the same thing. A HTML tag is like a container for either content or other HTML tags. A HTML element consists of the start tag + content tag + end tag. Some HTML tags do not have end tags like img hence in those cases HTML element will consist of start tag + content.<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>What are void elements in HTML?</span><br>
                        HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example: br, img, hr, etc.<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>What are HTML Entities?</span><br>
                        In HTML some characters are reserved like &ldquo;&#60;&ldquo;, &ldquo;&#62;&ldquo;, &ldquo;&#38;&ldquo;, etc. To use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character entities called HTML Entities<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>What is the difference between &#60;strong&#62;, &#60;b&#62; tags and &#60;em&#62;, &#60;i&#62; tags?</span><br>
                        The effect on a normal webpage is the same. &#60;b&#62; and &#60;i&#62; tags stands for bold and italic. These two tags only apply font styling. &#60;strong&#62; and &#60;em&#62; are semantic. Hence these are preferred in modern web pages.<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>What is the difference between “display: none” and “visibility: hidden”, when used as attributes to the HTML element?</span><br>
                        When we use the attribute “visibility: hidden” for an HTML element then that element will be hidden from the webpage but still takes up space. Whereas, if we use the “display: none” attribute for an HTML element then the element will be hidden, and also it will not take up any space on the webpage<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>When to use scripts in the head and when to use scripts in the body?</span><br>
                        If the scripts contain some event-triggered functions or jquery library then we should use them in the head section. If the script writes the content on the page or is not inside a function then it should be placed inside the body section at the bottom<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>Is the &#60;datalist&#62; tag and &#60;select&#62; tag same?</span><br>
                        No, these tags are diffrent.  In the case of  &#60;select&#62; tag a user will have to choose from a list of options, whereas  &#60;datalist&#62; when used along with the  &#60;input&#62; tag provides a suggestion that the user selects one of the options given or can enter some entirely different value.<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>Is drag and drop possible using HTML5 and how?</span><br>
                        Yes, in HTML5 we can drag and drop an element. This can be achieved using the drag and drop-related events to be used with the element which we want to drag and drop.<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>What type of audio files can be played using HTML5?</span><br>
                        HTML5 supports the following three types of audio file formats: Mp3, WAV, Ogg.

                        <span class='yellow'>What is the Box model in CSS? Which CSS properties are a part of it?</span><br>
                        A rectangle box is wrapped around every HTML element. The box model is used to determine the height and width of the rectangular box. The CSS Box consists of Width and height (or in the absence of that, default values and the content inside), padding, borders, margin.<br><br>
                        <b>Content</b>:  Actual Content of the box where the text or image is placed.<br><br>
                        <b>Padding</b>: Area surrounding the content (Space between the border and content).<br><br>
                        <b>Border</b>: Area surrounding the padding.<br><br>
                        <b>Margin</b>: Area surrounding the border.

                        <span class='yellow'>What are the advantages of using CSS?</span><br>
                        <b>Separation of content from presentation</b> - CSS provides a way to present the same content in multiple presentation formats in mobile or desktop or laptop.<br>
                        <b>Easy to maintain</b> - CSS, built effectively can be used to change the look and feel complete by making small changes. To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.<br>
                        <b>Bandwidth </b>- Used effectively, the style sheets will be stored in the browser cache and they can be used on multiple pages, without having to download again.<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>What is a CSS Preprocessor?</span><br>
                        A CSS Preprocessor is a tool used to extend the basic functionality of default vanilla CSS through its own scripting language. It helps us to use complex logical syntax like - variables, functions, mixins, code nesting, and inheritance to name a few, supercharging your vanilla CSS.<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>What are Pseudo elements and Pseudo classes?</span><br>
                        <b>Pseudo-elements</b> allows us to create items that do not normally exist in the document tree. Examples:<br>
                        ::before<br>
                        ::after<br>
                        ::first-letter<br>
                        ::first-line<br>
                        ::selection<br><br>
                        <b>Pseudo-classes</b> select regular elements but under certain conditions like when the user is hovering over the link. Examples:<br>
                        :link<br>
                        :visited<br>
                        :hover<br>
                        :active<br>
                        :focus<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>Does margin-top or margin-bottom have an effect on inline elements?</span><br>
                        No, it doesn’t affect the inline elements. Inline elements flow with the contents of the page.<br><br>
                        <span class='yellow'>What is cascading in CSS?</span><br>
                        “Cascading” refers to the process of going through the style declarations and defining weight or importance to the styling rules that help the browser to select what rules have to be applied in times of conflict. The conflict here refers to multiple rules that are applicable to a particular HTML element. In such cases, we need to let the browser know what style needs to be applied to the element. This is done by cascading down the list of style declarations elements.<br><br>
